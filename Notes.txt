Notes -- Jesus 9.17

--> Don't need a sign up page. Unless, you want to create a view for customers.
--> I used the create user html but created a new file because for security concerns an administrator creating a new user and a client creating a profile should be treated differently. 
--> The user roaster needs to be connected to the backend and  to dynamically fill this table using js.
--> What does email management mean? should we be able to connect it to outlook or should we be able to send emails or send and receive emails....setting up a simple form to send emails that works is doable but the other two are a little harder. I would have to do research. 
--> We need to add Primary Keys to our Database and retrieve users using them. Employee ID...this will require editing the forms once this is done.
--> Administrator resetting account password functionality should be enough to send email or should the admin fill out a form and send a temporary password.
--> Reports and Notifications require the backend....we can build out the forms like the user roaster but we need data to display. 
--> share pages like IT ticket and logout page need to be refactor once we connect them to the database.
